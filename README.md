# MicroBlaze-RTL-Simulation-With-Fault-Injection
Based on my previous GitHub repository: https://github.com/reviver1z/MicroBlaze-RTL-Simulation
Bit-flips were injected into the BRAM signal of the MicroBlaze RTL Simulation system to demonstrate how a single fault can modify the result of summing 9 float values (1.0 + 2.0 + ... + 9.0 = 45.0).
