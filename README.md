# MicroBlaze-RTL-Simulation-With-Fault-Injection
Based on my previous GitHub repository: https://github.com/reviver1z/MicroBlaze-RTL-Simulation

Bit-flips were injected into the BRAM signal of the MicroBlaze RTL Simulation system to demonstrate how a single fault can modify the result of summing 9 float values (1.0+2.0+3.0+4.0+5.0+6.0+7.0+8.0+9.0=45.0).
